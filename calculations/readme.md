# Creating new wordnetts
This is a folder containing scripts for generating new valid wordnetts. 

## What is here?
* `generate_wordnetts.py` - Contains the script that generates a json file containing valid wordnetts. The script tries to generate a random wordnett and then checks how many valid solutions the generated wordnett has. If the wordnett has to many or to few solutions we trouh it out and try again.
 
* `nsf2021.txt` - A list containing all valid norwegian words.
